        Crypto space can be complex and unpredictable. It’s directly linked with the Bitcoin exchange rate, technological and community risks, and mining difficulties. And of course this makes it difficult to determine  what exact amount you will make mining.. But it is obvious that being part of a community building such an elegant piece of disruptive technology, bound to become more stable and robust, is very exciting.
