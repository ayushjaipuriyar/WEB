      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>It’s a genre of online games which blend survival and combat, with a whole load of players dropped into a large level. The idea is simple: to be the last man (or team) standing. Typically, you drop down into the map armed with nothing (or little), and have to scavenge weapons, ammo, armor, and other equipment that might help you survive – or indeed make sure that your opponents don’t survive.<br>

As time ticks on, the habitable area of the map shrinks – enforced by some manner of mechanism that damages the player, like a storm or radiation – to stop people camping or hiding from each other for ages. And eventually, there’s only one survivor, the winner (who gets a chicken dinner, naturally).</p></div>

        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-book icon"></span>APEX Legends</h3>
        <p>Respawn officially announced its free to play take on battle royale in a dramatic fashion—the same day it launched. Apex Legends combines a hero squad shooter with the last-man-standing formula, and it became an instant hit, racking up 50 million players in its first month. It's already added a ninth character and with novel systems that allow great mic-less communication and the respawning of dead teammates, it's quickly become the battle royale to watch in 2019.

        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-document-text icon"></span>Fortnite</h3>
        <p>Fortnite was a worldwide phenomenon in 2018, providing a bright and arcadey experience to counter PUBG's measured pace and gritty vibe. Epic isn't shy about experimenting with wacky modes like 50 vs 50, making frequent and sometimes mysterious changes to its map, or by adding, of all things, airplanes. We don't expect the surprising, game-changing experiments to stop anytime soon. If you enjoy games like Fortnite, read on. <br><br>

          <h3><span class="typcn typcn-cog-outline icon"></span>PUBG</h3>
          <p>We don't know if there will be a PUBG movie, but at this point we wouldn't really be surprised (we even came up with a script). PUBG had a busy 2018, adding a third map called Sanhok and a winter map, Vikendi, plus new features like dynamic weather and bullet penetration. Expect new modes, weapons, vehicles, and maybe even more maps to keep trickling in as they have since it was released. PUBG will continue to be a major force in battle royale in 2019.</p>

        <div class="six columns">
          <h3><span class="typcn typcn-lightbulb icon"></span>Battlefield 5 Firestorm</h3>
          <p>Battlefield 5's battle royale mode, Firestorm, has arrived, supporting 64 players and featuring stunning visuals and fantastic sound design. Matches take place on the largest map in Battlefield history, filled with destructible buildings and vehicles like Panzer tanks. Firestorm may not be quite the reason to buy Battlefield 5, though, especially when a game like Apex Legends is available for free. But it's still a fun and frantic battle royale mode.</p>
